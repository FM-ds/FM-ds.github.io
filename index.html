                so. The second chart shows how, simultaneously, Korea's population is expected to decline.

            <h3> Week 2 </h3>
        
            <summary> The first chart is a recreation of a chart from <i>'IMF bailouts hit record high as global economic outlook worsens. </i> The values in the first have been converted from IMF SDRs to USD. In the second, total borrowing is shown relative to total holdings. 
                <p> <b>Riskiest Year:</b> Perhaps counterintuitively, I think the most risky years were in the early 2000s (e.g. 2003) when lending was greatest relative to holdings.</p>

                In these two figures, I visualise related emissions data. The first is cross-sectional, showing the relationship between GDP Per Capita and emissions. The second shows multiple timeseries, illustrating trends in consumption emissions.
                <p> <b>Differences in Encodings: </b> The second uses a temporal versus quantitive encoding, with a line marker. I chose this as trends in emmisions are important in understanding the climate-crisis.  </p>

                <b> Argument: </b>At the Big Data Event, <a href="https://www.tizianaalocci.com">Tiziana Alocci</a> briefly spoke about the 'exciting' potential of combining audio and visualization. This inspired me to try and represent some data through audio. 
                <p> <b> Finding: </b> Positively, on the audio chart, time is mapped to time: an advantage. However, interaction takes longer. I believe the potential is exciting however. </p>
                <p> I chose to use trade war data, representing rounds of tarrifs through tones of different volumes presented on a prototype created with d3 and then conventionally with Vega.</p>
